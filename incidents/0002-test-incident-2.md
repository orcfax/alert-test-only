## Additional Notes

Test incident 2.

For the community requiring support of Oracle services it is important we
investigate the social aspects of maintaining a liquidity pool and
communicating changes. In a production scenario, for example, the change to the
liquidity pool may have been better communicated. In another scenario there
may be better technological triggers that we, as an oracle, can pick up on.
Both examples here could be topics of future Catalyst proposals.

## Technical improvements

We are investigating:

1. Regenerating CNT feed configuration on a more regular basis so as to identify
   changes quicker.
1. Socio-technical approaches to following liquidity pools more effectively.
1. Identifying properties of stale feeds that can be implemented statelessly
   in an oracle solution.

## Documentation improvements

1. N/A.
